# Program 0 is intended to help you become familiar with your tools: git/GitHub.
# We will be using GitHub (+git) to both manage and submit your programs.
# Think of GitHub as a cross between Dropbox and incremental backups for code.
# For program 0, please just edit this file, and push it to GitHub.
# (Hopefully, by the time you read this, you have already found a git client.)
# Just follow the instructions below...
